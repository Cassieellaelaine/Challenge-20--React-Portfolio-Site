        <p>
            I have learned JavaScript, NodeJS, React, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, SQL Server, and JQuery.
            I have also been employed in the Tech industry since 2012 and hold several IT certificates and college degrees.
            Upon graduating for the FullStack Coding Bootcamp, I plan to do freelance coding and to also work as an engineering lead. 
            In my free time, I enjoy attending various technology conventions, building mobile apps, and volunteering with "Girls Who Code".
